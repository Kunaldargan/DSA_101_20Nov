## Course Plan<a name ="Plan"></a>
- **Divide and conquer** : As the name suggests “Divide and Conquer”. Divide the problems into
smaller sub-problems, solve them and combine their solution.(Link to be added)
- **Backtracking**: Incrementally attempt to build solution and “backtrack” to explore all
possibilities.(Link to be added)
-**Dynamic Programming** Divide the problem into overlapping subproblems of various sizes.
Use solution of smaller sub-problems to build solution of larger ones.(Link to be added)
- **Graph Algorithms** : Model a problem as a graph problem and use known graph algorithms.
Greedy algorithms Being greedy works! ... but only for certain problems.(Link to be added)
- *LeetCode and HackerRank* standard questions
